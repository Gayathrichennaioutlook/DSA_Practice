The code defines a template function that converts an instance of a Modular<T> object into a string.

Here's how the code works:
1. Modular Class:
The Modular<T> class, as you saw earlier, is designed to handle numbers under modular arithmetic. This class stores a number value and ensures that all operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respect a given modulus. When you perform operations on a Modular<T> object, it keeps its result in the range [0, mod).

2. The to_string Function:
This function takes a Modular<T> object as input and converts it into a string. Here's the breakdown:

cpp
Copy
Edit
template <typename T>
string to_string(const Modular<T>& number) {
  return to_string(number());
}
Input: A Modular<T> object number.
Output: The function returns a string representation of the underlying value stored in the Modular<T> object.
Step-by-Step Explanation:
number(): This part calls the operator() (which is defined in the Modular<T> class) to retrieve the actual value stored in the modular number. This value is the number modulo some modulus mod().

cpp
Copy
Edit
const Type& operator()() const { return value; }
The operator() simply returns the internal value (the modular number itself).
to_string(number()): The to_string function in C++ converts its argument into a string representation. So, to_string(number()) converts the result of number() (the underlying integer value) into a string.

Example Scenario:
Let’s assume







You said:
// U == std::istream? but done this way because of fastinput
template <typename U, typename T>
U& operator>>(U& stream, Modular<T>& number) {
  typename common_type<typename Modular<T>::Type, int64_t>::type x;
  stream >> x;
  number.value = Modular<T>::normalize(x);
  return stream;
}
ChatGPT said:
This code defines a custom input stream operator (operator>>) for the Modular<T> class. This operator allows you to input a value into a Modular<T> object using standard input (std::cin) or any other input stream (like file streams).

Explanation of the Code:
cpp
Copy
Edit
template <typename U, typename T>
U& operator>>(U& stream, Modular<T>& number) {
  typename common_type<typename Modular<T>::Type, int64_t>::type x;
  stream >> x;
  number.value = Modular<T>::normalize(x);
  return stream;
}
What does this code do?
Template Parameters:

U: The input stream type. It can be any stream type, but it's usually std::istream for standard input (std::cin).
T: The type of the modulus used in the Modular<T> class.
Define the Input Process:

The operator>> reads a value from the stream (U& stream) and stores it into the Modular<T> object (number).
Define the Temporary Variable (x):

cpp
Copy
Edit
typename common_type<typename Modular<T>::Type, int64_t>::type x;
This line defines a variable x that will hold the input value.
Modular<T>::Type refers to the underlying type of the Modular<T> class (e.g., int, int64_t).
common_type<...> ensures that x has a compatible type that can handle both the modular value and any potentially large input (like int64_t).
Reading the Input:

cpp
Copy
Edit
stream >> x;
The input stream (stream) reads a value and stores it in x.
Normalizing the Input Value:

cpp
Copy
Edit
number.value = Modular<T>::normalize(x);
Once the input is read, the value is normalized using the normalize method of the Modular<T> class to ensure it stays within the valid range [0, mod).
normalize(x) adjusts the value by:
Making sure the value fits within the modulus.
Handling negative values by shifting them into the correct positive range.
Return the Input Stream:

cpp
Copy
Edit
return stream;
The function returns the input stream (stream) to allow for chaining multiple inputs (like std::cin >> x >> y;).
Example Usage:
cpp
Copy
Edit
using ModType = Modular<std::integral_constant<int, 1000000007>>;  // Modulo 10^9 + 7
ModType x;
std::cin >> x;  // Input a value into the Modular object 'x'
std::cout << "The value is: " << x() << std::endl;  // Output the modular value
When this code is executed:
The value for x will be read from std::cin.
After reading the value, x will be normalized to ensure it fits within the modulus (10^9 + 7 in this case).
Finally, you can access and print the modular value of x.
Why Use This?
Efficiency: By using operator>>, you can easily read modular numbers directly from the input stream, and they will be correctly normalized and wrapped within the modulus.
Compatibility: This allows your Modular<T> class to work seamlessly with standard input streams like std::cin.
Cleaner Code: This approach allows for cleaner and more intuitive code when handling modular numbers, as you don't need to manually normalize the values every time they are input.
Summary:
This code defines a custom input operator (operator>>) for reading values into the Modular<T> class. It reads the input value, normalizes it to the appropriate modulus, and stores it in the Modular<T> object. This makes it easier to work with modular numbers and input them directly from streams like std::cin.

This code defines a Depth-First Search (DFS) Forest class (dfs_forest) that extends a forest class (presumably a graph structure). It is specifically designed to perform DFS on a forest of trees and store various useful information during the traversal. Let's break it down:

Code Breakdown
cpp
Copy
Edit
class dfs_forest : public forest<T> {
This class inherits from forest<T>, meaning it extends the functionality of the base class forest<T>, which likely manages a collection of edges and vertices (i.e., a graph or forest of trees).

Member Variables:
cpp
Copy
Edit
vector<int> pv;      // Parent vector, stores the parent of each node.
vector<int> pe;      // Parent edge vector, stores the edge ID of the parent.
vector<int> order;   // DFS order, stores the order in which nodes are visited.
vector<int> pos;     // Position vector, stores the position in DFS order for each node.
vector<int> end;     // End time vector, stores the end time of DFS for each node.
vector<int> sz;      // Subtree size vector, stores the size of the subtree rooted at each node.
vector<int> root;    // Root vector, stores the root of the tree for each node.
vector<int> depth;   // Depth vector, stores the depth of each node in the DFS tree.
vector<T> dist;      // Distance vector, stores the distance of each node from the starting node.
These vectors are used to store the results and intermediate information during the DFS traversal:

pv: Parent of each node.
pe: The edge connecting a node to its parent.
order: The order in which the nodes are visited in DFS.
pos: Position of a node in the DFS traversal order.
end: End time for DFS in post-order.
sz: Size of the subtree rooted at each node.
root: The root node of the tree containing each node.
depth: Depth of each node in the DFS traversal.
dist: Distance from the root (or starting node).
Constructor and Initialization:
cpp
Copy
Edit
dfs_forest(int _n) : forest<T>(_n) {
}

void init() {
  pv = vector<int>(n, -1);
  pe = vector<int>(n, -1);
  order.clear();
  pos = vector<int>(n, -1);
  end = vector<int>(n, -1);
  sz = vector<int>(n, 0);
  root = vector<int>(n, -1);
  depth = vector<int>(n, -1);
  dist = vector<T>(n);
}
The constructor initializes the dfs_forest object by calling the base class (forest<T>) constructor to initialize the graph structure.
init() sets up all the data structures (vectors) to track DFS-related information. The vectors are initialized with default values:
-1 for vectors like pv, pe, pos, end, root, and depth to indicate uninitialized states.
0 for sz (subtree size).
Default values for dist are initialized with T{} (likely zero).
Clearing Data:
cpp
Copy
Edit
void clear() {
  pv.clear();
  pe.clear();
  order.clear();
  pos.clear();
  end.clear();
  sz.clear();
  root.clear();
  depth.clear();
  dist.clear();
}
The clear() function is used to reset all the data structures that were set up in init(). It clears all the vectors, effectively preparing the object for the next traversal or reset.
DFS Core:
cpp
Copy
Edit
private:
void do_dfs(int v) {
  pos[v] = (int) order.size();
  order.push_back(v);
  sz[v] = 1;
  for (int id : g[v]) {
    if (id == pe[v]) continue;
    auto& e = edges[id];
    int to = e.from ^ e.to ^ v;
    depth[to] = depth[v] + 1;
    dist[to] = dist[v] + e.cost;
    pv[to] = v;
    pe[to] = id;
    root[to] = (root[v] != -1 ? root[v] : to);
    do_dfs(to);
    sz[v] += sz[to];
  }
  end[v] = (int) order.size() - 1;
}
do_dfs(int v) is the actual recursive DFS function. Starting from node v:
It marks the position of the node in the DFS order.
It then traverses all adjacent nodes (g[v] is the adjacency list), skipping the parent node to avoid cycles.
For each visited node, it records:
Depth (depth[to]) and distance (dist[to]).
Parent (pv[to]), parent edge (pe[to]), and subtree size (sz[v]).
It recursively calls do_dfs for all child nodes.
After the traversal of a node's children, it updates the end time (end[v]).
Starting DFS:
cpp
Copy
Edit
void do_dfs_from(int v) {
  depth[v] = 0;
  dist[v] = T{};
  root[v] = v;
  pv[v] = pe[v] = -1;
  do_dfs(v);
}

public:
void dfs(int v, bool clear_order = true) {
  if (pv.empty()) {
    init();
  } else {
    if (clear_order) {
      order.clear();
    }
  }
  do_dfs_from(v);
}
dfs(int v) is the public method to start the DFS from node v.
It initializes the data structures if they are empty (init()).
Clears the DFS order if requested (clear_order).
Calls do_dfs_from(v), which initializes the root, depth, distance, and then calls do_dfs(v) to start the DFS traversal.
Performing DFS for All Nodes:
cpp
Copy
Edit
void dfs_all() {
  init();
  for (int v = 0; v < n; v++) {
    if (depth[v] == -1) {
      do_dfs_from(v);
    }
  }
  assert((int) order.size() == n);
}
dfs_all() performs DFS for all nodes in the graph (forest). It ensures that any unvisited node is processed:
Initializes the DFS structures.
Iterates over all nodes and calls do_dfs_from(v) for each node that hasn't been visited yet (i.e., depth[v] == -1).
After the DFS traversal, it asserts that all nodes have been visited (order.size() == n).
Summary of Functionality:
dfs_forest is a class that performs Depth-First Search (DFS) on a forest of trees (disjoint graph components).
It stores several useful attributes during DFS:
Parent, subtree size, DFS order, depth, distance from root, and root of the tree each node belongs to.
It provides the ability to:
Start DFS from a specific node (dfs(int v)).
Perform DFS for all nodes in the forest (dfs_all()).
clear() and init() allow for resetting the DFS data structures.
do_dfs(int v) is the core function that recursively traverses the graph and computes the various properties.
This class is useful for graph traversal in problems where you need to store additional information about the traversal, such as subtree sizes, depths, distances, and DFS order, for each node in a forest of trees.

This code performs centroid decomposition on a tree (represented as a forest of trees). Let's break it down step by step to understand what the code is doing.

Overview of Centroid Decomposition:
Centroid decomposition is a divide-and-conquer technique used to decompose a tree into smaller subtrees (called centroids) for efficient queries and updates. The centroid of a tree is a node that, when removed, results in subtrees where each subtree has at most half of the nodes of the original tree.

The process of centroid decomposition involves:

Finding the centroid of the tree.
Removing the centroid and recursively decomposing the remaining subtrees.
Code Breakdown:
Function Definition:
cpp
Copy
Edit
vector<int> centroid_decomposition(const forest<T>& g) {
The function takes a forest g (a collection of trees) and returns a vector of centroids.
The type T refers to the data type used for edge weights or the data in the tree.
Initialize Variables:
cpp
Copy
Edit
int n = g.n;                          // Number of nodes in the graph.
vector<bool> alive(n, true);           // Track whether nodes are alive (part of the current tree).
vector<int> res;                       // Store the resulting centroids.
res.reserve(n);                        // Reserve space for `n` centroids.
vector<int> sz(n);                     // Stores the size of the subtree rooted at each node.
n: The number of nodes in the forest g.
alive: A boolean vector to track if a node is still part of the tree being decomposed.
res: A vector to store the centroids found.
sz: A vector to store the size of the subtree for each node.
DFS to Calculate Subtree Sizes:
cpp
Copy
Edit
auto Dfs = [&](auto&& self, int v, int pr) -> void {
  sz[v] = 1;
  for (int eid : g.g[v]) {
    auto& e = g.edges[eid];
    int u = e.from ^ e.to ^ v;
    if (u != pr && alive[u]) {
      self(self, u, v);
      sz[v] += sz[u];
    }
  }
};
This is a recursive DFS function that calculates the size of the subtree rooted at each node.
The recursion avoids revisiting the parent node (pr) and only explores nodes that are alive (part of the current tree).
sz[v] is updated to include the size of its subtree by adding the size of all its child subtrees.
Finding the Centroid:
cpp
Copy
Edit
auto Build = [&](auto&& self, int v) -> void {
  Dfs(Dfs, v, -1);  // Calculate subtree sizes starting from node `v`.

  int c = v;        // Start with node `v` as the candidate centroid.
  int pr = -1;      // No parent initially.

  while (true) {
    int nxt = -1;
    for (int eid : g.g[c]) {
      auto& e = g.edges[eid];
      int u = e.from ^ e.to ^ c;
      if (u != pr && alive[u] && 2 * sz[u] > sz[v]) {
        nxt = u;   // Move to the child subtree if it has more than half the size of the current tree.
        break;
      }
    }
    if (nxt == -1) {
      break;  // Stop if no suitable child is found.
    }
    pr = c;
    c = nxt;  // Update `c` to the child subtree with more than half the size.
  }

  res.push_back(c);  // `c` is the centroid of the current tree.
  alive[c] = false;  // Mark the centroid as no longer part of the tree.

  for (int eid : g.g[c]) {
    auto& e = g.edges[eid];
    int u = e.from ^ e.to ^ c;
    if (alive[u]) {
      self(self, u);  // Recursively decompose the remaining subtrees.
    }
  }
};
Build is the function that finds a centroid and recursively decomposes the tree.
It starts by calculating the subtree sizes (Dfs(Dfs, v, -1)).
It then iteratively finds the centroid:
A node c is the centroid if, when removed, all remaining subtrees have at most half of the nodes of the original tree.
If a child subtree has more than half the nodes, the algorithm moves to that child and repeats the process.
Once a centroid c is found, it is added to the result (res.push_back(c)), and c is marked as no longer part of the tree (alive[c] = false).
It then recursively decomposes the remaining subtrees (self(self, u)).
Main Loop to Decompose the Entire Forest:
cpp
Copy
Edit
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  if (alive[i]) {
    Build(Build, i);  // Start the decomposition from each alive node.
  }
}
This loop iterates over all nodes in the forest.
For each node that is still alive, it calls Build(Build, i) to find its centroid and decompose the tree.
Return the Centroids:
cpp
Copy
Edit
return res;
After the decomposition process, the function returns the list of centroids found in the forest.
Summary of What This Code Does:
Centroid Decomposition: The code decomposes a tree (or forest) into its centroids.

A centroid is a node such that, if removed, no subtree contains more than half of the nodes in the original tree.
The decomposition process involves:
Finding the centroid.
Removing it from the tree.
Recursively applying the process to the remaining subtrees.
Steps in the Code:

DFS: The Dfs function is used to compute the subtree sizes for each node.
Centroid Finding: The Build function finds a centroid and decomposes the tree.
Decomposition: The main loop iterates through all nodes in the forest, performing decomposition for each connected component (tree).
Output:

The function returns a vector of the centroids of the tree (or forest).
Use Cases:
Efficient Query Handling: After centroid decomposition, you can perform efficient queries and updates on the tree (e.g., path queries, distance queries, etc.).
Divide-and-Conquer: It is often used in problems requiring divide-and-conquer strategies on trees.

This code defines a Fenwick Tree (also known as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)), which is a data structure used for efficiently querying and updating prefix sums in a list of numbers. It allows for efficient cumulative sum calculations in O(log n) time.

Let's break it down step by step:

Class Definition:
cpp
Copy
Edit
class FenwickTree {
 public:
  vector<T> fenw;  // The Fenwick Tree array (stores the sums)
  int n;           // The size of the tree (number of elements)
  int pw;          // The largest power of 2 less than or equal to n

  // Constructor (default and parameterized)
  FenwickTree() : n(0) {}
  FenwickTree(int n_) : n(n_) {
    fenw.resize(n);   // Resizes the Fenwick Tree array to size n
    pw = bit_floor(unsigned(n));  // Determines the largest power of 2 ≤ n
  }
fenw is a vector that stores the Fenwick Tree. Each index in this vector holds cumulative sums (partial sums).
n is the total number of elements that the tree manages.
pw is used to store the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n. It helps in binary operations within the tree.
Modify (Update Function):
cpp
Copy
Edit
void Modify(int x, T v) {
  assert(0 <= x && x < n);  // Ensure the index is within bounds
  while (x < n) {
    fenw[x] += v;         // Update the Fenwick Tree by adding value v at index x
    x |= x + 1;           // Move to the next index in the binary representation (propagate the change)
  }
}
Modify(x, v) updates the Fenwick Tree by adding v to index x.
The x |= x + 1 operation is a binary manipulation that moves the index to the next relevant index in the Fenwick Tree (based on its binary representation).
This ensures that the tree is updated correctly for all relevant positions.
Query (Prefix Sum Function):
cpp
Copy
Edit
T Query(int x) {
  assert(0 <= x && x <= n);  // Ensure the index is within bounds
  T v{};  // Initialize a variable to store the result (sum)
  while (x > 0) {
    v += fenw[x - 1];         // Add the value at the current index to the sum
    x &= x - 1;               // Move to the parent index (using binary representation)
  }
  return v;
}
Query(x) returns the sum of the first x elements of the array.
The binary manipulation x &= x - 1 efficiently finds the parent index in the Fenwick Tree, which allows us to accumulate the sum of all relevant segments of the tree.
The sum is accumulated in v, which is then returned.
MaxPrefix (Find the Length of the Longest Prefix with Sum ≤ c):
cpp
Copy
Edit
int MaxPrefix(T c) {
  T v{};    // Initialize sum
  int at = 0;  // Start from the root of the tree
  for (int len = pw; len > 0; len >>= 1) {
    if (at + len <= n) {
      auto nv = v;
      nv += fenw[at + len - 1];  // Try adding the current segment to the sum
      if (!(c < nv)) {           // Check if the sum is still <= c
        v = nv;
        at += len;               // Move to the next index
      }
    }
  }
  assert(0 <= at && at <= n);
  return at;
}
MaxPrefix(c) finds the longest prefix whose sum is less than or equal to c.
It does so by iterating over the binary representation of the range. For each step, it adds the current segment to the running sum (v), and checks if the sum is still less than or equal to c.
The function iterates in binary chunks (which is why it uses powers of 2), effectively finding the prefix that satisfies the condition.
The result is the length of the prefix, which is returned.
Key Operations in Fenwick Tree:
Modify (Update):

Update the value at a specific index in O(log n) time.
Ensures that the prefix sums remain correct after an update.
Query (Prefix Sum):

Query the cumulative sum of elements from index 1 to x in O(log n) time.
Allows efficient computation of partial sums without needing to iterate over the entire array.
MaxPrefix (Find Longest Prefix with Sum ≤ c):

Efficiently finds the longest prefix of elements with a sum less than or equal to a given value c in O(log n) time.
Time Complexity:
Modify(x, v):

O(logn)
Query(x):

(

𝑛
)
O(logn)
MaxPrefix(c):

These operations are all logarithmic in complexity, which is highly efficient compared to iterating through the entire array.

Example Usage:
Initialization:
cpp
Copy
Edit
FenwickTree<int> ft(10);  // Fenwick Tree for an array of size 10 (with integers)
Update (Modify):
cpp
Copy
Edit
ft.Modify(3, 5);  // Add 5 to index 3 of the Fenwick Tree
Prefix Sum (Query):
cpp
Copy
Edit
int sum = ft.Query(5);  // Get the sum of the first 5 elements
Find Max Prefix (MaxPrefix):
cpp
Copy
Edit
int length = ft.MaxPrefix(20);  // Find the longest prefix whose sum is <= 20
Summary:
The Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) is an efficient data structure for:
Updating an element in an array in O(log n) time.
Querying the prefix sum in O(log n) time.
Performing other operations like finding the longest prefix sum efficiently.
This is highly useful for problems involving dynamic range queries, where you frequently need to update values and compute sums over ranges in an array.

This code is solving a graph-based problem that involves centroid decomposition and dynamic programming techniques to compute an answer related to paths in trees. The problem is likely related to tree path sums or subtree queries with additional constraints. Here's an explanation of the different parts of the code:

Code Breakdown
1. Input and Initialization
cpp
Copy
Edit
ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
cin.tie(nullptr);
int tt;
cin >> tt;
ios::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(nullptr) are used to speed up input/output operations by disabling the synchronization between C++ streams and C-style streams.
tt is the number of test cases.
2. Input for Each Test Case
cpp
Copy
Edit
while (tt--) {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<int> a(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
  }
  forest<int> g(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    --x; --y;
    g.add(x, y);
  }
For each test case:
n is the number of nodes in the tree.
a is a vector storing some data associated with each node.
forest<int> g(n) initializes a forest (or tree) with n nodes.
The loop reads n-1 edges and adds them to the graph g.
3. Centroid Decomposition
cpp
Copy
Edit
auto seq = centroid_decomposition(g);
vector<bool> alive(n, true);
centroid_decomposition(g) is called to decompose the tree (or forest) g into centroids. This step breaks the tree into smaller subproblems for more efficient querying.
alive[n] is a boolean array used to mark which nodes are still alive during the decomposition process.
4. The Solve Lambda Function
cpp
Copy
Edit
auto Solve = [&](vector<pair<int, int>> p) -> Mint {
  int cnt = int(p.size());
  vector<int> xs(cnt);
  for (int i = 0; i < cnt; i++) {
    xs[i] = p[i].second;
  }
  ranges::sort(xs);
  xs.resize(unique(xs.begin(), xs.end()) - xs.begin());
  int sz = int(xs.size());
  FenwickTree<int> f0(sz);
  FenwickTree<Mint> f1(sz);
  ranges::sort(p);
  Mint ret = 0;
  for (int i = cnt - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int at = int(ranges::lower_bound(xs, p[i].second) - xs.begin());
    Mint sum_mx = (f1.Query(sz) - f1.Query(at)) + Mint(f0.Query(at)) * p[i].second;
    ret += sum_mx * p[i].first;
    f1.Modify(at, +p[i].second);
    f0.Modify(at, +1);
  }
  return ret;
};
This is a lambda function called Solve that performs a specific computation.
p is a vector of pairs that likely represents ranges or subtree values.
The function uses two Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees), f0 and f1, to efficiently compute prefix sums for the problem.
It then processes the values in reverse order, updating the trees and computing the required result ret.
FenwickTree<int> and FenwickTree<Mint> are used to manage range queries and updates efficiently.
The function returns a modular sum (Mint) of the computed values.
5. Processing Each Centroid
cpp
Copy
Edit
Mint ans = 0;
for (int c : seq) {
  alive[c] = false;
  vector<int> go;
  for (int eid : g.g[c]) {
    auto& e = g.edges[eid];
    int u = e.from ^ e.to ^ c;
    if (alive[u]) {
      go.push_back(u);
    }
  }
  vector<pair<int, int>> p;
  for (int r : go) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> pp;
    auto Dfs = [&](auto&& self, int v, int pr, int mn, int mx) -> void {
      ans += Mint(mn) * mx;
      pp.emplace_back(mn, mx);
      p.emplace_back(mn, mx);
      for (int eid : g.g[v]) {
        auto& e = g.edges[eid];
        int u = e.from ^ e.to ^ v;
        if (u != pr && alive[u]) {
          self(self, u, v, min(mn, a[u]), max(mx, a[u]));
        }
      }
    };
    Dfs(Dfs, r, c, min(a[r], a[c]), max(a[r], a[c]));
    ans -= Solve(pp);
  }
  ans += Solve(p);
}
For each centroid c in the decomposed tree (seq), the code performs:
Marks the centroid as not alive.
Identifies the connected subtrees (go stores nodes connected to the centroid c).
A DFS traversal (Dfs) is performed to explore all the nodes connected to the centroid.
During the DFS, the min and max values of each subtree are computed and stored.
The results of the DFS are then used in the Solve function to compute a modular sum.
The result is accumulated in ans.
6. Output the Answer
cpp
Copy
Edit
cout << ans << '\n';
After processing all centroids and subtrees, the result ans is printed for the current test case.
Summary:
Input Parsing:

The number of test cases is read, and for each test case, the number of nodes and the tree structure (edges and node values) are read.
Centroid Decomposition:

The tree is decomposed into centroids using the centroid_decomposition function. Centroids help break the tree into smaller subtrees, allowing efficient processing.
Solving Using Fenwick Trees:

A DFS traversal is done for each subtree rooted at the centroids.
During the DFS, modular sums are computed using Fenwick Trees (f0 and f1).
The results are accumulated using the Solve lambda function.
Final Answer:

The answer for the current test case is stored in ans, which is then printed.
Key Techniques Used:
Centroid Decomposition: Helps break the tree into smaller parts for more efficient processing.
Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree): Used for efficient range queries and updates.
Depth-First Search (DFS): Traverses subtrees while computing the required values (min and max).
Modular Arithmetic (Mint): Used to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.
This code is likely solving a complex tree query problem, where centroid decomposition helps manage large input sizes, and Fenwick Trees efficiently manage range sum queries.
